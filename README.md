# Final Trip / Dernier voyage

**Final Trip** is a community initiative aimed at addressing the challenges faced by African, particularly Cameroonian, diaspora members when a loved one passes away abroad. Its goal is to prevent the need for public fundraising campaigns for repatriation and funeral arrangements, providing a dignified and organized way to ensure the respectful return of the deceased to their homeland. This initiative involves various Cameroonian groups and associations working together to ease the financial and emotional burdens of bereaved families.

## About Final Trip

With the rise in cases of Cameroonian community members passing away in foreign countries, the need for public fundraisers for repatriation has grown. Final Trip aims to end this by organizing collective contributions within the community, where the costs for each member are lowered as the group size increases. 

The initiative is designed to ensure that the deceased’s final wishes or the bereaved family’s needs are met with dignity, love, and humanity. It encourages community members to prepare for the inevitable by becoming members of the network, helping to prevent tragic situations where individuals die in isolation and lack support from their community.

## Our Mission

One of the key objectives of **Final Trip** is to motivate every member of the African diaspora, particularly in Germany, to join an association or community group. This prevents the isolation of individuals who may not have any connections within the community, avoiding situations where someone's nationality and identity are only discovered after their death. The initiative emphasizes the importance of belonging to a supportive group, ensuring dignity in death as well as in life.
